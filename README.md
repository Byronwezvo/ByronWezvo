# 👋 Hello World, I'm Byron Wezvo!

Self-taught software sorcerer hailing from the vibrant tech scene in Zimbabwe 🌍. I embarked on my coding journey at the ripe age of 16 and haven't looked back since. While I might not be a mythical 10X developer, my trajectory in the tech realm has been nothing short of exciting.

## 💻 Current Quest: Fullstack Developer at FBC Holdings - Ourisk 🚀

I'm currently enchanting the digital realm with my skills as a Fullstack developer. Working on a clandestine, closed-source application that's leaving a mark in the technological tapestry. It's a secret potion of innovation and challenges that keeps me spellbound.

## 🌱 Current Incantation: **NOTHING** (Lost in the labyrinth of closed-source enchantments)

In the enchanted forest of code, I find myself navigating the mystical landscape of a closed-source application. Every line of code is a step deeper into the unknown, and I'm relishing the adventure.

## 🤝 Seeking Magical Alliances

I'm always open to collaborations of all kinds. Whether it's weaving spells with JavaScript or orchestrating symphonies with Flutter, I'm ready to join forces with fellow tech wizards.

## 💬 Ask Me About

Venture into the depths of my knowledge and ask me about the ancient scrolls of Javascript and Flutter. I've mastered the art of coding incantations and can guide you through the enchanted realms of these languages.

## 📬 How to Summon Me

Find me in the digital realms of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as `@byronwezvo`. Send a message, cast a spell, or just drop an emoji – I'm always up for a magical conversation.

## 👨‍💻 My Tech Spellbook

I wield the powers of MERN and Flutter, but recently, I've fallen madly in love with the enchanting CoakroachDB. My spells include Javascript/Typescript, Python, Go, Dart, Lua, and a sprinkle of C#. As a Nodejs Backend Developer, I'm the architect of digital realms.

## 🤔 In the Potion Lab

During my free time, you'll find me concocting potions and occasionally tinkering with spells for the sheer thrill of it. Nothing too serious, just a bit of harmless hacking for the love of the craft.

Join me on this magical journey through the bytes and spells, and let's create enchanting code together! ✨🔮
